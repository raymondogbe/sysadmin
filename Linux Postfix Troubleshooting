QUESTION:
Some users of the monitoring app have reported issues with xFusionCorp Industries mail server. 
They have a mail server in Stork DC where they are using postfix mail transfer agent. 
Postfix service seems to fail. Try to identify the root cause and fix it.


SOLUTION:
I was getting a "failed" error when I checked the status of the postfix.service
At first, I thought that the postfix service is disabled or uninstalled.
I went ahead to reinstall postfix service but thid didnt resolve the issue.
sudo yum install postfix

ssh into the mail server
ssh username@mailserver and login to as root

systemctl status postfix --- To check the status of postfix
#Error message:  postfix.service - Postfix Mail Transport Agent
   #Loaded: loaded (/usr/lib/systemd/system/postfix.service; enabled; vendor preset: disabled)
   #Active: failed (Result: exit-code) since Sun 2021-11-14 13:35:04 UTC; 2min 15s ago
  #Process: 618 ExecStart=/usr/sbin/postfix start (code=exited, status=1/FAILURE)
  
  
vi /etc/postfix/main.cf ---- To log into postfix configuration and make the neccessary changes.
The changes made are as follows:
Modify the following two things for this configuration:
inet_protocols = ipv4
inet_interfaces = all

systemctl start post
systemctl enable postfix
Finally, I check the status again and it was running
systemctl status postfix
