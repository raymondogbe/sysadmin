QUESTION:
We have one of our websites up and running on our Nautilus infrastructure in Stratos DC. 
Our security team has raised a concern that right now Apacheâ€™s port i.e 8086 is open for all since there is no firewall installed on these hosts. 
So we have decided to add some security layer for these hosts and after discussions and recommendations we have come up with the following requirements:
Install iptables and all its dependencies on each app host. Block incoming port 8086 on all apps for everyone except for LBR host.
Make sure the rules remain, even after system reboot.


SOLUTION:
To install iptable packages from yum command use following:-
yum install -y iptables && yum install -y iptables-services. Do these for all the apps servers

Then append the first rule which is to allow connection to the LBR Host: To all incoming traffic to LBR
sudo iptables -A INPUT -p tcp --dport 8081 -s 172.16.238.14 -j ACCEPT    172.16.238.14 is the LBR ip

Next is to append the second rule blocking all other connections to the port:
sudo iptables -A INPUT -p tcp --dport 6100 -j DROP

Now, To save permanently and restart in order for the changes to be established
sudo service iptables save && sudo systemctl restart iptables

PS: This would only work if iptables was installed as a service.
