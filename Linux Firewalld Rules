QUESTION:
The Nautilus system admins team recently deployed a web UI application for their backup utility running on the Nautilus backup server in Stratos Datacenter. 
The application is running on port 5003. They have firewalld installed on that server. The requirements that have come up include the following:
Open all incoming connection on 5003/tcp port. Zone should be public.


SOLUTIONS:
SSH username@ip or domain

To install firewall
#sudo yum install firewalld

Check the state or status of firewall
sudo firewall-cmd --state

To print the zone configuration settings
#sudo firewall-cmd --zone=public --list-all

To start the firewalld service
#sudo systemctl start firewalld
#sudo systemctl enable firewalld


Open all incoming connection on 5003/tcp port. Zone should be public.
#sudo firewall-cmd --add-service=http --permanent
#sudo firewall-cmd --permanent --zone=public --add-interface=eth0
#sudo firewall-cmd --permanent --zone=public --add-port=5003/tcp
#sudo firewall-cmd --reload


Note:
By default, when making changes to the Firewalld configuration using the firewall-cmd utility, the changes are applied to the runtime configuration. 
To make the changes permanent you need to use the --permanent option.
