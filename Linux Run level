QUESTION:
New tools have been installed on the app server in Stratos Datacenter. Some of these tools can only be managed from the graphical user interface. 
Therefore, there are requirements for these app servers.
On all App servers in Stratos Datacenter change the default runlevel so that they can boot in GUI (graphical user interface) by default.


SOLUTION:
SSH into the app server 
ssh username@ip or domain

To check the version of linux distro
#cat /etc/*release

To get what is your default runlevel
#systemctl get-default

To change to runlevel 5
#sudo systemctl set-default runlevel5.target

Remember, multi-user.target is runlevel 3 and graphical.target is runlevel 5
