QUESTION:
A developer Kareem has been assigned Nautilus project temporarily as a backup resource. 
As a temporary resource for this project, we need a temporary user for Kareem. 
Itâ€™s a good idea to create a user with a set expiration date so that the user won't be able to access servers beyond that point.
Therefore, create a user named kareem on the App Server 3. Set expiry date to 2021-03-28 in Stratos Datacenter. Make sure the user is created as per standard and is in lowercase.


SOLUTION:
ssh into appserver3
Change to root admin using sudo su
useradd kareem
#chage -E "2021-03-28" kareem -------- This is for Account expiry

On a side note for password expiry
#chage -M number-of-days username -----This is for Password Expiry
