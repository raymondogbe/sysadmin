QUESTION:
There is a critical issue going on with the Nautilus application in Stratos DC. 
The production support team identified that the application is unable to connect to the database. 
After digging into the issue, the team found that mariadb service is down on the database server.
Look into the issue and fix the same.



SOLUTION:
Having checked using the neccessary command, I realized that MariaDB was not active, hence, the reason why the application was not able to connect to the DB.
Check the status of Mariadb
systemctl status mariadb   
systemctl status mariadb.service

To uninstall Mariadb server in order to reinstall
yum remove mariadb mariadb-server 
rm -rf /var/lib/mysql ------ remove the mariadb dir

To Reinstall Mariadb
yum install mariadb mariadb-server

To start and enable Mariadb
systemctl start mariadb ----- To start mariadb 
systemctl enable mariadb ---- to enable mariadb

Once all is done, recheck the status of Mariadb and it should show ".active".
systemctl status mariadb.service ------ To check status
