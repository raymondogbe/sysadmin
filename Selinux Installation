QUESTION:
The xFusionCorp Industries security team recently did a security audit of their infrastructure and came up with ideas to improve the application and server security. 
They decided to use SElinux for an additional security layer. 
They are still planning how they will implement it; however, they have decided to start testing with app servers, so based on the recommendations they have the following requirements:

Install the required packages of SElinux on App server 2 in Stratos Datacenter and disable it permanently for now; it will be enabled after making some required configuration changes on this host. 
Don't worry about rebooting the server as there is already a reboot scheduled for tonight's maintenance window. Also ignore the status of SElinux command line right now; the final status after reboot should be disabled.

SOLUTION:
SELinux or Security-Enhanced Linux is a mechanism or security module that provides access control security policies. 
In simple terms, itâ€™s a feature or service used for restricting users to certain policies and rules set by the systems administrator.

Use sudo rpm -aq | grep selinux to check what packages are installed.
# sudo rpm -aq | grep selinux

Install SELinux: 
#yum install policycoreutils policycoreutils-python selinux-policy selinux-policy-targeted libselinux-utils setroubleshoot-server setools setools-console mcstrans
Use #getenforce and #sestatus to check status
Use #cat /etc/selinux/config to check SELinux configuration
Set the SELinux attribute to disabled in the configuration file:
vi etc/selinux/config or vi /etc/sysconfig/selinux for permanently disabled status after reboot. 
change the selinux = disable
