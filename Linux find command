QUESTION
 Copy all files with .js extension with their parent folder from /var/www/html/blog to blog



SOLUTION:
find /var/www/html/blog -type f -name '*.js' -exec cp --parents {} /blog \; 
Though blog folder was already available in the root folder ./blog, the syntax above copies all files ending with .js into the .blog
