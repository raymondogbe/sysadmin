QUESTION:
The system admin team of xFusionCorp Industries has noticed an issue with some servers in Stratos Datacenter where some of the servers are not in sync w.r.t time. 
Because of this, several application functionalities have been impacted. To fix this issue the team has started using common/standard NTP servers. 
They are finished with most of the servers except App Server 1. Therefore, perform the following tasks on this server:
Install and configure NTP server on App Server 1.
Add NTP server 1.sg.pool.ntp.org in NTP configuration on App Server 1.



SOLUTION:
SSH into the AppServer1 and make sure you are logged into root.

Confirm if ntp service is installed, otherwise, install it
#rpm -qa |grep ntp

Install ntp service
#yum install -y ntp

Open the ntp service add the server (server 1.sg.pool.ntp.org) as instructed
vi /etc/ntp.conf

Start and enable the ntp service
#systemctl enable ntpd
#systemctl start  ntpd
