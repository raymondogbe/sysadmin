QUESTION:
During a recent security audit, the application security team of xFusionCorp Industries found security issues with the Apache web server on Nautilus App Server 2 server in Stratos DC. 
They have listed several security issues that need to be fixed on this server. Please apply the security settings below: 

a. On Nautilus App Server 2 it was identified that the Apache web server is exposing the version number. Ensure this server has the appropriate settings to hide the version number of the Apache web server.

b. There is a website hosted under /var/www/html/blog on App Server 2. It was detected that the directory /blog lists all of its contents while browsing the URL. Disable the directory browser listing in Apache config.

c. Also make sure to restart the Apache service after making the changes.



SOLUTION:

a. Ensure this server has the appropriate settings to hide the version number of the Apache web server.
Add the following lines in the httpd.conf to version apache version
 vi /etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf   
ServerSignature Off
ServerTokens Prod

Once it is done, you must systemctl restart httpd.service to restart the conf

b.
Also, add the following lines in the document root to disable the directory listing in the same  vi /etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf   
<Directory "/var/www/html/<Folder>"> 
Options -Indexes 
AllowOverride None 
Require all granted
</Directory>


c.
Once again, restart the service.
systemctl restart httpd.service
use curl -I http://172.16.238.12:8080 to recheck the version if it is still displayed
