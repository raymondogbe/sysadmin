Question:
We have a backup management application UI hosted on Nautilus's backup server in Stratos DC. 
That backup management application code is deployed under Apache on the backup server itself, and Nginx is running as a reverse proxy on the same server. 
Apache and Nginx ports are 5003 and 8098, respectively. We have iptables firewall installed on this server. 
Make the appropriate changes to fulfill the requirements mentioned below:
We want to open all incoming connections to Nginx's port and block all incoming connections to Apache's port. Also make sure rules are permanent.


SOLUTION:
SSH into backup server and add these two rules
Make sure that you are logged in as root
systemctl status iptables
iptables -L
iptables -A INPUT -p tcp --dport 8098 -m conntrack --ctstate NEW,ESTABLISHED -j ACCEPT
iptables -A INPUT -p tcp --dport 5003 -m conntrack --ctstate NEW -j REJECT   You can also use this to block a port

Then save it by typing following command
sudo iptables-save > /etc/sysconfig/iptables
systemctl restart iptables.service to restart the service To make sure the the changes are established.
service iptables save make sure the rules remain even after system reboot

Now, check if the rules are added or not using the below command
cat /etc/sysconfig/iptables
