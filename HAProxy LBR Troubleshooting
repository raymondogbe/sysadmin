QUESTION:
xFusionCorp Industries has an application running on Nautlitus infrastructure in Stratos Datacenter. 
The monitoring tool recognised that there is an issue with the haproxy service on LBR server. 
That needs to fixed to make the application work properly.

SOLUTION:
Troubleshoot and fix the issue, and make sure haproxy service is running on Nautilus LBR server.
The most common use of the HAProxy application is to distribute the workload across multiple servers e.g., web server, 
database server, etc thus improving the overall performance and reliability of server environment.

#"sudo haproxy -c -f /etc/haproxy/haproxy.cfg" --- Used to check for errors
from the error, I realized that the service is not active, therefore, we need to start and enable the haproxy service

#sudo systemctl start haproxy
#sudo systemctl enable haproxy
#sudo systemctl status haproxy
