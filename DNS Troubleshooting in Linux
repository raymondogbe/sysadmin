QUESTION
The system admins team of xFusionCorp Industries has noticed intermittent issues with DNS resolution in several apps . 
App Server 1 in Stratos Datacenter is having some DNS resolution issues, so we want to add some additional DNS nameservers on this server.
As a temporary fix we have decided to go with Google public DNS (ipv4). Please make appropriate changes on this server.




SOLUTION
According to the question, we only needed to add some additional DNS nameservers on this server.
For this purpose, we need to edit the /etc/resolv.conf, which is the DNS SERVER and add the following below:
nameserver 8.8.8.8
nameserver 8.8.4.4
